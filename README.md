# Stack Overflow Survey EDA

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the survey responses, understand trends in the developer community, and visualize key patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which contains responses from developers worldwide about their demographics, programming habits, and career preferences.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, filtering relevant columns, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key trends.
- **Insights & Visualization:** Generating meaningful plots and charts to summarize findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data manipulation and visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data handling and transformation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for running the analysis and presenting results)

## Key Findings
- Insights into developer demographics, programming languages, and career trends.
- Comparison of salaries based on experience and geographic location.
- Analysis of job satisfaction and work-life balance among developers.
  
## Conclusion
This project successfully explores and visualizes key insights from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. By analyzing the dataset, we gained valuable information about developer trends, preferences, and work environments. The findings can be useful for developers, recruiters, and organizations to understand the evolving landscape of the tech industry. Future improvements can include deeper analysis on emerging technologies and machine learning-based predictions for career trends.
